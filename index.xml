      <description>TheFifthWaffle is an independent game company founded and operated by three brothers. Initially finding success at local gamejams and hackathons, they decided to put their skills to use as a team with one on music, two on programming, and all on art. Their first game, GunFu Heroes, which will be released on Steam on July 22, 2019 for $4.99, is a love letter to the games they played together growing up.</description>

      <description>Background In the year 21xx, the show GunFu Heroes&amp;rsquo; ratings have declined. In a desperate ploy to revitalize the show&amp;rsquo;s former glory, the show&amp;rsquo;s executives have started &amp;ldquo;recruiting&amp;rdquo; fighters from across both time and space. Prove your worth in the arena with an array of weapons and feed the corporate machine with the spoils of war.
So what is it? GunFu Heroes is a quick-paced, local multiplayer party game where your goal is to be the last one standing.</description>
